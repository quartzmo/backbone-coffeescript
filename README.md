backbone-coffeescript
===================================

Code examples from the interactive [Backbone + CoffeeScript](http://www.scriptybooks.com/books/backbone-coffeescript) book published by ScriptyBooks LLC.

## Build

Each chapter directory already contains the generated JavaScript output from the CoffeeScript and Eco template files. However, you can use the `Makefile` contained within each chapter directory to rebuild after making any changes. On the command line, simply navigate to the chapter directory and enter `make`. See the `Makefile` for convenient watch targets.

Building requires you to install Node.js, npm, CoffeeScript, and Eco. See the [Setup and Structure](http://www.scriptybooks.com/books/backbone-coffeescript/chapters/application-structure) chapter for installation instructions.

## Tests

You can run the browser-based [Mocha]() tests by opening the test/index.html page contained within each chapter directory. Running the tests should not require any external dependencies.
